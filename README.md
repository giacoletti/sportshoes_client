## Development notes

- I had to cut the first and second slide of the slideshow/carousel to make it flush at the bottom. An alternative would have been squeezing the height to make them flush, but it would have distorted the images.
- I was not able to retrieve the right Google Font from the .psd file provided. I have 'Krita' on my Linux computer, which is an open-source graphics editor kinda like Photoshop, but I'm not very familiar with it. As a result I've choosen Google Fonts that were a close match.
- I have applied a 'fade' effect to the slideshow. I think it's nicer than the classic sliding, but this should be discussed with the team/product owner.
